### LSTM Stock Price Prediction for TATA Motors

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict TATA Motors' stock prices based on historical data.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and normalized the stock price data using pandas and NumPy to ensure accurate model training.
- **LSTM Model**: Built an LSTM neural network using TensorFlow and Keras, incorporating layers for feature extraction and time series prediction.
- **Model Training**: Trained the model on historical 'Open' prices to predict future prices, using Mean Squared Error as the loss function.
- **Visualization**: Plotted the predicted vs. actual stock prices to evaluate model performance, and forecasted the next 10 days' prices.

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to time series data for stock price prediction, with a focus on using LSTM networks.
